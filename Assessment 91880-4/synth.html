       <!-- Synth plugin information -->
    <p>Sound design is an essential part of music these days and so it's important to have good quality synthesizers at your disposal. While default synths in many DAWs are fine, some just lack the capability or flexibility to do certain things and some are just hard to use. All the synths I will talk about here are synths that bring something unique to the table or are just really powerful.</p>

    <!-- Vital -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Matt Tytel - Vital</h1>
    <p>Many people say that Vital is like free Serum because it's so high quality. This is absolutely true. Of all the plugins I talk about across all pages of this website, Vital is easily the best. It's a wavetable synth with enough features to create virtually any sound you can think of. It has many features designed to edit waveforms and you can get drastically different sounds even from the most basic of waveforms. It has easy modulation and custom LFO shapes which you can drag to automate any parameter you can think of. Above all of that, it has a seperate window to add effects to the sound such as distortion, chorus and delay. These effects are simple to use and are quite high quality. The main thing I love about the plugin is that all of the changes being made to the sound are represented visually with animations which makes the plugin really easy to learn. This makes the plugin a great introduction to sound design. Overall, you absolutely need this plugin.</p>

    <!-- Podolski -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">U-HE - Podolski</h1>
    <p>Podolski is a synthesizer made by U-HE. The main feature of the synth is its built-in arpeggiator section which can be used to make great sounding patterns. On the main synthesis page, the synth contains one oscillator, a filter, 2 effects (chorus and delay), two LFOs and an envelope. The synth is also polyphonic with up to 16 voices, however you can also set it to be mono, legato and arpeggiated too. The arpeggiator tab gives you controls over the individual note length, the pitch of each note, how fast the notes are played and many other useful controls. This section can create amazing sounding arpeggios which are relatively easy to understand. If sound designing things yourself isn't really your thing though, the synth comes with over 300 great sounding presets to get you started. Overall, this synth is an amazing tool to have at your disposal and is an easy way to start making arpeggios.</p>

    <!-- Tyrell N6 -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">U-HE - Tyrell N6</h1>
    <p>Tyrell N6 is another very powerful synth by U-HE. The synthesizer was originally going to be a hardware synthesizer but it eventually became the free virtual synth we know today. The synth itself is akin to older analogue synthesizers and the feel of designing sounds with it has the same vibe. The synth has 2 oscillators, noise, 2 LFOs, 2 ADSR envelopes, modulation, a filter and up to 8 voices of unison for basic sound design. It also has a chorus effect built into it which can be used for some nice stereo spread. The synth also has a drift setting which when on, adds an effect to the sounds which makes them sound more natural and varied. Along with the synth also comes over 580 great sounding factory presets for many different purposes. You can also save your own presets. Overall, this synth is a very powerful tool to have at your disposal and can create some amazing sounds. I highly recommend this especially if you want to make sounds similar to classic analogue synths.</p>

    <!-- Pendulate -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Newfangled Audio - Pendulate</h1>
    <p>Pendulate is an incredibly unique mono synth which is unlike anything I've seen before. It uses a double pendulum oscillator which creates chaotic sounds which never would've been created without this synth. The synth can create all sorts of sounds ranging from a simple sine wave to complete chaos. The synth's other features include a wavefolder which can adjust a sine wave sound with many different parameters. It also includes modulation which can modulate almost every parameter. It has a low pass gate and ADSR controls which are standard for synths as well as options to control pitch bending, portamento and legato. One thing that's great about this synth is its visual quality. It has animations to show what's happening to the sounds and also 3 different colour schemes for the synth which you can set. The main limitation of this synth is that it's monophonic which means only one note can be played at a time. Overall though, this extremely unique synth is worth having a play around with.</p>
