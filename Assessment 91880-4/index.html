    <!-- home page info -->
    <p>Welcome to the home page. This website contains many different plugins which I have found to be useful. The best part is that all of them are completely free! I've made sure to accommodate for music producers of most genres so whoever you are, you'll find a plugin that you'll enjoy. The plugins are grouped into 3 categories: Effect plugins, instrument plugins and synthesizers. Each plugin will also have an audio demo, a photo of their interface and download button which links straight to the plugin's download page. The default audio demo is below. This tune will be played with different instruments and effects based on which plugin is being demonstrated.</p>

    <!-- Effect Plugins -->
<h1 class="rcorners" style="background-image: url(header%20effect%20blur.jpg);background-size: 800px">Effect Plugins</h1>
    <p>Effect plugins are almost essential for modifying sounds in your mix and sometimes the default plugins just don't cut it. On this page of the site, I will list some of the best free effect plugins that I've found for various purposes. Notably: reverb, chorus, bitcrush, and many more. It doesn't matter what genre of music you produce, you will likely find a use for all of these.</p>

    <!-- Instrument Plugins -->
    <h1 class="rcorners" style="background-image: url(header%20instrument%20blur.jpg);background-size: 800px">Instrument Plugins</h1>
    <p>Many DAWs don't come with good quality instrument plugins to begin with and many people spend money to get higher quality ones. Fortunately, there are many free instrument plugins which already sound very professional and high quality. On this page, I will list a few great plugins for pianos, guitars, drums and a few others. Having these instruments at your disposal is a great way to make your songs sound less samey as not all the instruments will just be synthesizers.</p>

    <!-- Synth Plugins -->
    <h1 class="rcorners" style="background-image: url(header%20synth%20blur.jpg);background-size: 800px">Synth Plugins</h1>
   <p>Sound design is an essential part of music these days and so it's important to have good quality synthesizers at your disposal. While default synths in many DAWs are fine, some just lack the capability or flexibility to do certain things and some are just hard to use. All the synths I will talk about here are synths that bring something unique to the table or are just really powerful.</p>
