       <!-- Instrument plugin information -->
    <p>Many DAWs don't come with good quality instrument plugins to begin with and many people spend money to get higher quality ones. Fortunately, there are many free instrument plugins which already sound very professional and high quality. On this page, I will list a few great plugins for pianos, guitars, drums and a few others. Having these instruments at your disposal is a great way to make your songs sound less samey as not all the instruments will just be synthesizers.</p>

    <!-- Quiet Piano -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Quiet Music - Quiet Piano</h1>
    <p>Quiet Piano is a piano plugin which doesn't just have the usual piano sound. While there isn't much room for sound design, the 8 presets sound great enough that you only really need the sound design tools they provided. The sounds in question are very ambient with amazing reverbs and are just the right thing to give a good vibe to your tracks. The plugin itself was created for relaxing, ambient and lo-fi music. However, I believe that the sounds are definitely flexible enough to extend into many other genres too. I recommend this plugin to everyone and especially lo-fi and ambient producers. </p>

       <!-- Spitfire Audio Labs -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Spitfire Audio - Labs</h1>
    <p>Spitfire Audio Labs isn't just one sound, but a gigantic library of extremely high quality sounds for many different instruments. It contains many atmospheric pad sounds but also quite a few very high quality sampled instrument sounds. Some sounds I recommend are their soft piano and drum sounds. This is a plugin which you'll likely be able to get infinite use out of since there are so many sounds to choose from. The downside of this plugin is that it doesn't have many parameters to edit the sounds on and the sound libraries take up a lot of storage on your device. I still highly recommend this plugin though. It's easily the most extensive instrument plugin on this list.</p>

       <!-- Classic Gtr Lite -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Quiet Music - Classic.Gtr Lite</h1>
    <p>Classic Gtr Lite is the free version of one of Quiet Music's other plugins, Classic Gtr. On the website, the plugin is described as a "Spanish guitar VST." Like many of Quiet Music's plugins, this plugin is tailored towards more ambient and chill music and so while the guitar sound isn't always incredibly realistic, it does sound really nice still. The plugin comes with 7 different presets which all have their uses and have a very high quality sound. The plugin also comes with controls for ADSR, cutoff frequency, volume and modulation. Overall, if you're looking for a high quality acoustic guitar sound then this plugin might be for you. </p>

       <!-- Drum Pro -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Studiolinked - Drum Pro</h1>
    <p>Drum Pro is a great sounding sample based electronic drum plugin. It has sounds for many different genres of music and is very easy to use. The plugin has 20 drum kits with each kit containing 12 different sampled sounds. 9 of the drum kits are sampled from vintage drum machines so if you want that old drum machine sound you can have that. The plugin isn't all just samples though, it has ways to shape the sound of the samples too. It has ADSR controls, reverb and volume and panning controls which are separate for each sample. Overall, this plugin is great for if you want some electronic drums in your songs and it's surprisingly versatile for a free plugin.</p>
