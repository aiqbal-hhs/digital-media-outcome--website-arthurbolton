    <p>Effect plugins are almost essential for modifying sounds in your mix and sometimes the default plugins just don't cut it. On this page of the site, I will list some of the best free effect plugins that I've found for various purposes. Noteably: reverb, chorus, bitcrush, and many more. It doesn't matter what genre of music you produce, you will likely find a use for all of these.</p>

    <!-- Valhalla Supermassive -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Valhalla - Supermassive</h1>
    <p>Valhalla Supermassive is an incredibly unique reverb plugin which gives sounds <bold>massive</bold> swelling reverbs and delays. Some of the presets take minutes to decay completely and some of them can make even the most flat sounds into massive swells of reverb. As you can probably tell by reading this, this plugin is a must-have for any ambient music producers. However, the plugin is also great for creating unique sounds that can extend to nearly any genre. It's a wonder that a plugin like this is free so I recommend getting your hands on it and trying it out.</p>

    <!-- iZotope Vinyl -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">iZotope - Vinyl</h1>
        <p>If you're a lo-fi producer, then iZotope vinyl is a must have plugin for you. It emulates the effects that old vinyl records have such as warp, scratches and dust. It also contains <a class="pimitate" href="Secret.html">a</a> selection which makes the vinyl record sound older or newer. The interface for iZotope Vinyl is simple and easy to learn which is great since it has so many parameters. If you aren't a lo-fi producer then this plugin may not be of much use to you, but if you ever need a powerful vinyl emulator then this is the go  to plugin.</p>

    <!-- Krush -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Tritik - Krush</h1>
    <p>Krush is a free bitcrush plugin which has some pretty cool ways to control it. It obviously has the bitcrush section which will likely give you all you want with the plugin - the bitcrush effect. But it also has a modulation section, a low pass and high pass filter with resonance and a dry/wet control. These are obviously really useful to control your sound exactly how you want it. This plugin is also useful because some DAWs don't even come with a built in bitcrush plugin so being able to get a free one of this quality is amazing for producers that need it. Highly recommended if you're in need of some bitrushing.</p>

        <!-- Wider -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Polyverse and Infected Mushroom - Wider</h1>
    <p>Wider is a plugin designed to enhance the stereo image of a sound. This means that you can easily control exactly how wide a sound is without using panning. The interface for this plugin is extremely simple, however don't let this fool you into thinking the plugin isn't powerful. This plugin is incredibly useful for mixing as it's often difficult to make a sound wider without chorus or panning. The sound quality of this plugin is also incredibly high which is always what you should be looking for in a free plugin. Overall, this plugin is worth a download. Your mixes will thank you.</p>
