    <p>Many DAWs don't come with good quality instrument plugins to begin with and many people spend money to get higher quality ones. Fortunately, there are many free instrument plugins which already sound very proffesional and high quality. On this page, I will list a few great plugins for pianos, guitars, wind instruments and a few others. Having these instruments at your disposal is a great way to make your songs sound less samey as not all the instruments will just be synthesizers.</p>

    <!-- Quiet Piano -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Quiet Music - Quiet Piano</h1>
    <p>Quiet Piano is a piano plugin which doesn't just have the usual piano sound. While there isn't much room for sound design, the 8 presets sound great enough that you only really need the sound design tools they provided. The sounds in question are very ambient with amazing reverbs and are just the right thing to give a good vibe to your tracks. The plugin itself was created for relaxing, ambient and lo-fi music however I believe that the sounds are definitely flexible enough to extend into other genres too. I recommend this plugin to everyone and especially lo-fi and ambient producers.</p>

       <!-- Spitfire Audio Labs -->
    <h1 class="rcorners">Spitfire Audio - Labs</h1>
    <p>Spitfire Audio Labs isn't just one sound, but a gigantic library of extremely high quality sounds for many different instruments. It contains many atmospheric pad sounds but also quite a few very high quality sampled instrument sounds. Some sounds I recommend are their soft piano and drum sounds. This is a plugin which you'll likely be able to get infinite use out of since there are so many sounds to choose from. The downside of this plugin is that it doesn't have many parameters to edit the sounds on and the sound libraries take up a lot of storage on your device. I still highly recommend this plugin though. It's easily the most extensive plugin on this list.</p>
